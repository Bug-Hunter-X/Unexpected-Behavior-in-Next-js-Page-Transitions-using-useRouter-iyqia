# Next.js Unexpected Page Transition Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to page transitions in Next.js applications when using the `useRouter` hook.  The issue revolves around the initial render of the destination page, especially when data fetching or other asynchronous operations are performed.

## Problem Description

When navigating from one page to another using `router.push()`, the destination page may briefly render with incomplete or outdated data before the asynchronous operations are completed. This can lead to a flickering or inconsistent user experience.

## Solution

Implementing proper loading states and data handling techniques helps mitigate this issue.  This example uses a loading indicator to show that the data is being fetched before displaying the actual content.

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate between the Home and About pages.  Observe the initial render behavior of each page.

## Additional Notes

This bug is not always apparent and can be influenced by the complexity of the asynchronous operations on the page being navigated to.  Understanding how Next.js handles the initial render of components during client-side transitions is crucial for avoiding such unexpected behavior.
